# Tauwarp

Tauwarp — n. A research framework for re-parameterizing clock time t into a hypothesized “true time” variable \tau using non-linear mappings, and testing the resulting predictions against precision measurements from laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological systems.

Testing the limits of linear time — Tools and workflows for probing non-linear time hypotheses using data from atomic clocks, pulsars, and cosmology.

## Overview

This repository implements the Non-Linear Time Hypothesis, which proposes that the true physical time variable \tau may be a non-linear function of laboratory time t:

\tau = f(t) \neq at + b

If true, this would leave a subtle but universal fingerprint across every process with a predictable time law — from the ticking of atomic clocks, to pulsar rotations, to the expansion history of the universe.

## Tauwarp provides:

 •	Functions to re-parameterize time series (t \to \tau) under simple test forms like \tau = t + \varepsilon t^2.

 •	Residual-generation tools to see how these warps affect different datasets.

 •	Bayesian fitting workflows for cross-domain constraints on the warp parameter ε.

## Why it matters

Time is treated as linear in all mainstream physics, but this assumption has never been directly tested across the widest possible range of scales.

Tauwarp enables a unified analysis using:

 •	Laboratory clocks — long-term optical and microwave comparisons.

 •	Astrophysical timers — millisecond pulsars, gravitational-wave chirps, strong-lens delays.

 •	Cosmological baselines — supernovae, BAO, and CMB acoustic features.

By applying the same model across radically different domains, we can either:

 •	Set the tightest cross-domain bounds yet on non-linear time.

 •	Or detect a consistent deviation worth deeper investigation.
