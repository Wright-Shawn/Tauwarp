Tauwarp — n. A research framework for re-parameterizing clock time (t) into a hypothesized “true time” variable τ using non-linear mappings, and testing the resulting predictions against precision measurements from laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological systems.

Testing the limits of linear time; Tools and workflows for probing non-linear time hypotheses using data from atomic clocks, pulsars, and cosmology.

## Overview

This repository implements the Non-Linear Time Hypothesis, which proposes that the true physical time variable τ may be a non-linear function of laboratory time t:

τ = f(t) ≠ a·t + b

If true, this would leave a subtle but universal fingerprint across every process with a predictable time law, from the ticking of atomic clocks, to pulsar rotations, to the expansion history of the universe.

## Tauwarp provides:

• Functions to re-parameterize time series (t → τ) under simple test forms like τ = t + ε·t².

• Residual-generation tools to see how these warps affect different datasets.

• Bayesian fitting workflows for cross-domain constraints on the warp parameter ε.

## Why it matters

Time is treated as linear in all mainstream physics, but this assumption has never been directly tested across the widest possible range of scales.

Tauwarp enables a unified analysis using:

• Laboratory clocks — long-term optical and microwave comparisons.

• Astrophysical timers — millisecond pulsars, gravitational-wave chirps, strong-lens delays.

• Cosmological baselines — supernovae, BAO, and CMB acoustic features.

By applying the same model across radically different domains, we can either:

• Set the tightest cross-domain bounds yet on non-linear time.

• Or detect a consistent deviation worth deeper investigation.

## Data

This project can operate on synthetic data or public datasets.

•	Place tiny synthetic CSVs in data/samples/ (ignored by git).

•	For public datasets, link to the source and keep only scripts that download/process them.

## Planned Features

•	Interactive Jupyter notebook demos for warp parameter fitting

•	Synthetic dataset generator for hypothesis stress-testing

•	Cross-dataset Bayesian fitting pipeline

•	Visualization module for τ vs. t mappings
